# Tango Solver

Tango solver can solve any valid tango board with a recursive backtracking algorithm. Inspired by [Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/description/).

This app will also obtain LinkedIn's daily Tango puzzle by scraping their webpage with puppeteer and the [browerless](https://www.browserless.io/) service. This serverless function is hosted on vercel (but it's super slow :/).
